_PRINTF(1)		GENERAL COMMANDS MANUAL		_PRINTF(1)

NAME
	_printf -- formatted output
SYPNOSIS
	_printf format [arguments ....]
DESCRIPTION
	The _printf utility formats and prints its arguments. The format is
	 a character string that contains three types of elements: plain characters,
	 character
	 esacpe sequences(\n, " "), and format specifiers. This function writes output
	 to stdout.

RETURN VALUE
_printf returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte).
If an output error is found, a negative value is returned.
Each format specifier is introduced by the percent character '%'.
_printf can print 7 different format specifiers:

%d: prints ints;
%i: prints ints;
%c: prints the first char character;
%s: prints entire strings;
%r: reverses the string
%R: prints the string with a rot13 encryption;
%b: prints the binary value of an unsigned int;
%%: prints a % sign;

The arguments are used in the order they are given. An error will occur if there are more
arguments than
specifiers, or specifiers than arguments.

If no specifier is used, _printf will print all printable characters of the argument
as long as the characters are within "double quotes".
If the format has a '%' percent character but no specifier:
a '%' followed by a number will print blank empty space, including an empty space
where the first '%' is found.
a '%' followed by an alphabetical character will also print empty space.

Currently, as of 3/20/2020, _printf can not print decimals, hex values, floats, or
longs.
_printf does not consider field width, precision, flags, or length modifiers.


BUGS
The return value may not accurately return the number of characters printed.
