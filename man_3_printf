NAME
	_printf -- formatted output
SYPNOSIS
	_printf format [arguments ....]
DESCRIPTION
	The _printf utility formats and prints its arguments. The format is a character string that contains three types of elements: plain characters, character esacpe sequences(\n, " "), and format specifiers. This function writes output to stdout. 

RETURN VALUE
_printf returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte). 
If an output error is found, a negative value is returned. 
Each format specifier is introduced by the percent character '%'. 
_printf can print 7 different format specifiers:

%d: prints ints;
%i: prints ints;
%c: prints the first char character;
%s: prints entire strings;
%r: reverses the string
%R: prints the string with a rot13 encryption;
%%: prints a % sign;

The arguments are used in the order they are given. An error will occur if there are more arguments than specifiers, or specifiers than arguments. 

If the format has a '%' percent character but no specifier:
a '%' followed by a number will print blank empty space, including an empty space where the first '%' is found. 
a '%' followed by an alphabetical character will also print empty space. 

Currently, as of 3/20/2020, _printf can not print decimals, hex values, floats, or longs. 


BUGS
The return value may not accurately return the number of characters printed.
